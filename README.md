## Yet Another GameBoy Emulator

A project I started for learning purposes. This is my first emulator project, and is not intended for actual use (at least, not right now).
Also this is still in a super early stage of development, since this is just a side project that I am working on occasionally.

TODO List:

* CPU (<- i am here)
* BUSes
* RAM/ROM
* PPU
* APU
